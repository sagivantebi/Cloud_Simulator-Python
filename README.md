# Cloud Simulator - Python Project

This project simulates a basic cloud environment using Python. The project consists of a server and client component, enabling the simulation of client-server interactions in a cloud environment. This simulation could be used for educational purposes or as a foundation for more complex cloud-based applications.

## Project Structure

- **client.py**: The client-side script that simulates a client interacting with the cloud server.
- **server.py**: The server-side script that handles requests from the client and provides the necessary services or responses.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
- **Networking**: Make sure that your system's firewall allows communication on the ports used by the server and client.

## Setup and Running the Simulation

### Running the Server

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Cloud_Simulator-Python-main
   ```

2. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   python3 server.py
   ```

   The server will start and listen for incoming connections from clients.

### Running the Client

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Cloud_Simulator-Python-main
   ```

2. **Run the client**:
   ```bash
   python3 client.py
   ```

   The client will attempt to connect to the server and interact according to the predefined logic in the script.

## Example Workflow

1. Start the server by running `server.py`.
2. Start the client by running `client.py`.
3. Observe the interaction between the client and server, which simulates a cloud environment.
